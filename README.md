# WeatherApp

The Basic Weather App is an Android application developed using Kotlin programming language and powered by various Jetpack components. The app provides real-time weather information to users, including current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

The app follows a modern design approach, offering a clean and intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate. It incorporates a range of Jetpack components such as LiveData, ViewModel, and Room database to ensure efficient data management and a smooth user experience.

To collect weather data, the app integrates with an external weather information provider via an API (Application Programming Interface). Unfortunately, due to the expiration of the app's account with the weather information provider, the current version of the app is not functional in terms of retrieving real-time weather data. However, the app's structure and codebase remain intact, making it easy to reactivate the functionality by updating the account credentials or integrating with a different weather data provider.
